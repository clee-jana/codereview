Why do we do code reviews?

* Knowledge Transfer
* Increased Team Awareness
* Bugs

---

_Code review is the discipline of *discussing* your code with your peers._

---

_If content is king, then *context* is God._

-- Gary Vaynerchuck

Setting Context

* See #8123, sometimes bad
* PR Comment, good
* Face to Face, also good!

---

What to Review

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Naming
* Complexity
* Test Coverages
* - style

---

Discussion

* Ask don't tell

"Extract these methods to a new class."

---

"What do you think about extracting this method to a new class?"

---

"Can't you *just*..."
